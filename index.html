        (former Captain of International Indian Cricket Team)

      <p id="tribute-info">
        <strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong> (About this soundpronunciation
        (helpÂ·info) born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian international
        cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs
        formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. <br />
        Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20,
        the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013
        ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed explosive middle-order batsman and
        wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day
        Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is
        considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats.[2][3][4]<br />
        He is widely regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsman and
        captain in the history of the game.[5][6][7][8][9] He was also the first
        wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket. [10]

        <br />Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December, 2004 against Bangladesh,
        and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He has been
        the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year
        award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the
        Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth
        highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third
        highest civilian honour, in 2018.[11]<br /><br /><br />
        Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010
        and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI
        teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the
        honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel[12] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He
        is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.

        <br /><br />
        Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an
        Indian captain in ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an
        Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid
        in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in
        Sri Lanka and New Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in
        the final of the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first
        captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup,
        Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test
        captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and the
        West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In
        2009, Dhoni also led the Indian team to number one position for the
        first time in the ICC Test rankings.

        <br /><br />In 2013, under Dhoni's captaincy, India became the first
        team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series. In
        the Indian Premier League, he captained the Chennai Super Kings to
        victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with wins in the 2010
        and 2014 editions of Champions League Twenty20. In 2011, Time magazine
        included Dhoni in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most
        Influential People in the World."[13] Dhoni holds the post of
        Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India.
        India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier League team Chennai
        Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first IPL
        season.[14][15] He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December
        2014.[16] In 2012, SportsPro rated Dhoni as the sixteenth most
        marketable athlete in the world.[17] He is the co-owner of Indian Super
        League team Chennaiyin FC.[18] In June 2015, Forbes ranked Dhoni at 23rd
        in the list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his
        earnings at US$31 million.[19] In 2016, a biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold
        Story was made on his life and his cricket career up to the Indian
        team's win at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.
